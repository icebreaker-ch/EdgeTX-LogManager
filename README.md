# LogManager
A tool for managing LOG-Files in an EdgeTX b/w or color RC transmitter.
Actions can be performed on all models or a selected model.

Since the color version is using the LVGL widgets API, EdgeTX version 2.11 or later is needed to run. However,
the b/w version can be used on color radios with older versions of EdgeTX.
